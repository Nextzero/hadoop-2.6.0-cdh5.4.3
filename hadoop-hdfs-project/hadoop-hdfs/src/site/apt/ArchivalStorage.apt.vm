Archival Storage, SSD & Memory

%{toc|section=1|fromDepth=0}

* {Introduction}

  <Archival Storage> is a solution to decouple growing storage capacity from compute capacity.
  Nodes with higher density and less expensive storage with low compute power are becoming available
  and can be used as cold storage in the clusters.
  Based on policy the data from hot can be moved to the cold.
  Adding more nodes to the cold storage can grow the storage independent of the compute capacity
  in the cluster.

  The frameworks provided by Heterogeneous Storage and Archival Storage generalizes the HDFS architecture
  to include other kinds of storage media including <SSD> and <memory>.
  Users may choose to store their data in SSD or memory for a better performance.

* {Storage Types and Storage Policies}

** {Storage Types: ARCHIVE, DISK, SSD and RAM_DISK}

  The first phase of
  {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2832}Heterogeneous Storage (HDFS-2832)}}
  changed datanode storage model from a single storage,
  which may correspond to multiple physical storage medias,
  to a collection of storages with each storage corresponding to a physical storage media.
  It also added the notion of storage types, DISK and SSD,
  where DISK is the default storage type.

  A new storage type <ARCHIVE>,
  which has high storage density (petabyte of storage) but little compute power,
  is added for supporting archival storage.

  Another new storage type <RAM_DISK> is added for supporting writing single replica files in memory.

** {Storage Policies: Hot, Warm, Cold, All_SSD, One_SSD and Lazy_Persist}

  A new concept of storage policies is introduced in order to allow files to be stored
  in different storage types according to the storage policy.

  We have the following storage policies:

  * <<Hot>> - for both storage and compute.
              The data that is popular and still being used for processing will stay in this policy.
              When a block is hot, all replicas are stored in DISK.

  * <<Cold>> - only for storage with limited compute.
               The data that is no longer being used, or data that needs to be archived is moved
               from hot storage to cold storage.
               When a block is cold, all replicas are stored in ARCHIVE.

  * <<Warm>> - partially hot and partially cold.
               When a block is warm, some of its replicas are stored in DISK
               and the remaining replicas are stored in ARCHIVE.

  * <<All_SSD>> - for storing all replicas in SSD.

  * <<One_SSD>> - for storing one of the replicas in SSD.
                  The remaining replicas are stored in DISK.

  * <<Lazy_Persist>> - for writing blocks with single replica in memory.
                       The replica is first written in RAM_DISK and then it is lazily persisted in DISK.

  []

  More formally, a storage policy consists of the following fields:

  [[1]] Policy ID

  [[2]] Policy name

  [[3]] A list of storage types for block placement

  [[4]] A list of fallback storage types for file creation

  [[5]] A list of fallback storage types for replication

  []

  When there is enough space,
  block replicas are stored according to the storage type list specified in #3.
  When some of the storage types in list #3 are running out of space,
  the fallback storage type lists specified in #4 and #5 are used
  to replace the out-of-space storage types for file creation and replication, respectively.

  The following is a typical storage policy table.

*--------+---------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| <<Policy>> | <<Policy>>| <<Block Placement>>      | <<Fallback storages>> | <<Fallback storages>> |
| <<ID>>     | <<Name>>  | <<(n\ replicas)>>        | <<for creation>>      | <<for replication>>   |
*--------+---------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| 15     | Lasy_Persist  | RAM_DISK: 1, DISK: <n>-1 | DISK                  | DISK                  |
*--------+---------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| 12     | All_SSD       | SSD: <n>                 | DISK                  | DISK                  |
*--------+---------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| 10     | One_SSD       | SSD: 1, DISK: <n>-1      | SSD, DISK             | SSD, DISK             |
*--------+---------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| 7      | Hot (default) | DISK: <n>                | \<none\>              | ARCHIVE               |
*--------+---------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| 5      | Warm          | DISK: 1, ARCHIVE: <n>-1  | ARCHIVE, DISK         | ARCHIVE, DISK         |
*--------+---------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| 2      | Cold          | ARCHIVE: <n>             | \<none\>              | \<none\>              |
*--------+---------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

  Note that the Lasy_Persist policy is useful only for single replica blocks.
  For blocks with more than one replicas, all the replicas will be written to DISK
  since writing only one of the replicas to RAM_DISK does not improve the overall performance.

** {Storage Policy Resolution}

  When a file or directory is created, its storage policy is <unspecified>.
  The storage policy can be specified using
  the "<<<{{{Set Storage Policy}dfsadmin -setStoragePolicy}}>>>" command.
  The effective storage policy of a file or directory is resolved by the following rules.

  [[1]] If the file or directory is specificed with a storage policy, return it.

  [[2]] For an unspecified file or directory,
        if it is the root directory, return the <default storage policy>.
        Otherwise, return its parent's effective storage policy.

  []

  The effective storage policy can be retrieved by
  the "<<<{{{Set Storage Policy}dfsadmin -getStoragePolicy}}>>>" command.


** {Configuration}

  * <<dfs.storage.policy.enabled>>
    - for enabling/disabling the storage policy feature.
    The default value is <<<true>>>.

  []


* {Mover - A New Data Migration Tool}

  A new data migration tool is added for archiving data.
  The tool is similar to Balancer.
  It periodically scans the files in HDFS to check if the block placement satisfies the storage policy.
  For the blocks violating the storage policy,
  it moves the replicas to a different storage type
  in order to fulfill the storage policy requirement.

  * Command:

+------------------------------------------+
hdfs mover [-p <files/dirs> | -f <local file name>]
+------------------------------------------+

  * Arguments:

*-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| <<<-p \<files/dirs\>>>> | Specify a space separated list of HDFS files/dirs to migrate.
*-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| <<<-f \<local file\>>>> | Specify a local file containing a list of HDFS files/dirs to migrate.
*-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

  Note that, when both -p and -f options are omitted, the default path is the root directory.
